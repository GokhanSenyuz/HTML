<p class="biopara">My first role in the field of Biotechnology was working on a project 
to collect a million DNA samples from veterans for the United States Department of Veterans 
Affairs. The Boston VA Research Institute (BVARI), located at the Jamaica Plain Health Care 
Facility, was looking for an engineer who had experience in data extraction and normalization 
from disparate computer systems.</p>


<p class="biopara">While most of my day-to-day work did not involve biology, I did get 
experience working with researchers, as well as an introduction to the many legal issues 
surrounding the collection of human samples. I was contracted to create a master database 
of possible research candidates (veterans) and develop an application to solicit their 
participation in the program - Million Veteran Program
<a href="http://www.research.va.gov/mvp">(www.research.va.gov/mvp)</a>.</p>


<p class="biopara">Leveraging my limited experience in the field, I began to target academic 
institutions performing biotechnology research. My next role was as a Scientific System 
Administrator for a lab at the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) focusing on computational 
models for functional genomics in microbial communities.</p>


<p class="biopara">In this role, I was much more involved with the researchers and provided 
all the computational support for a large grant given to the HSPH from the Cohn's and Colitis 
Foundation. I was also charged with managing the bio-statistical systems for the research team. 
I worked closely with researchers and statisticians from all over the world. 
More information is available on the website 
<a href="http://www.huttenhower.org">(www.huttenhower.org)</a>.</p>


<p class="biopara">This is when I knew that this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my 
professional career. Not only did I get to work with the most intelligent people / researchers 
I had ever met, but the technological challenges were extremely exciting and rewarding.</p>


<p class="biopara">This fall I will be attending the 
<a href="http://www.bu.edu/biosci/">BioScience Academy</a> at Boston University 
Medical School full-time on a one-year scholarship. I look forward to the challenges ahead, 
both academic and professional.
