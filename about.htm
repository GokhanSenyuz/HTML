<p class="biopara">My first passion was general aviation and I started flying 
small planes when I was sixteen. After high school, I attended Embry-Riddle Aeronautical 
University in Prescott, Arizona for 2 years. Although I didn't have the resources to complete 
the program, I did earn a Commercial / Instrument license and have over 400 hours of flight time.</p>

<p class="biopara">When I returned to New London, New Hampshire, I attended the University of 
New Hampshire for Computer Science.  While in school, I lived at home and worked at Campion's 
(Dartmouth Outfitter) and for my aunt’s store, the Hanover Hardware Store.</p>

<p class="biopara">My first position was with Lockheed-Martin in Nashua NH, where I had numerous 
software development roles and completed a Master of Computer Science at Boston University. 
I've always liked the New Hampshire Seacoast, so after 5 years of Department of Defense work, 
I took a position at Cabletron Systems in Durham, NH, writing internet services.</p>

<p class="biopara">I've spent the majority of my profession career developing value-added 
services for the internet (network management, web platforms, VoIP, QOS, etc.), but for the 
last 6 years I've been more involved with cloud services. Most recently, I’ve worked in the 
<a href="biotechnology.htm">Biotechology</a> sector, helping researchers develop biostatistical 
platforms for big genomic data.

<p class="biopara">When I'm not busy being a student of science, I enjoy spending time with my 
three children and almost everything outside. I like to jog, bike, hike, sail and I'm 
an avid skier (water &amp; snow).</p>
